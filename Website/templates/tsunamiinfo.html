            <H2>Immediate Actions During A Tsunami</H2>
            <p>When a tsunami warning is issued, take immediate action to protect yourself and your loved ones. Here's what you should do:</p>
            <p>Natural Warning Signs: If you experience a long or strong earthquake or notice the sea behaving unusually (such as rapid changes in water level), consider it a potential tsunami threat.</p>
            <p>Official Warnings: Pay attention to official warnings issued by the Rescue Coordination Centre New Zealand (RCCNZ) via Maritime Radio. These warnings provide critical information.</p>
            <p>Evacuation: Always prioritize safety. Evacuate to higher ground or as far inland as possible. Don't wait for an official warningâ€”walk or bike if you can, as roads may become blocked quickly</p>
            <h2>After A Tsunami.</h2>
            <p>Returning Home: Only return home when authorities declare it safe. Listen to the radio or follow your local Civil Defence Emergency Management Group online for instructions.</p>
            <p>Expect More Shaking: If there was an earthquake before the tsunami, be prepared for additional shaking. Earthquake aftershocks could generate another tsunami.</p>
            <p>Stay Informed: Stay away from at-risk areas until the official all-clear is given</p>
            <h2>Remember that timely action during and precautions before can save lives during a tsunami.</h2>
